## Favorite Project
### [magnetwork](https://github.com/mcbosch/magnetwork)
In the past year, I worked on a project about Graph Neural Networks to classify metabolic networks. To solve this problem, I needed to extend these algorithms for graphs with directed atributes; I've done this working with magnetic graphs. Studying these graphs we observed some theorical aspects that wasn't solved.

This project aims to extend the `NetworkX` package, to have an easy tool to work with these kind of graphs, and be able to study the open questions and new approaches to classify graphs.
