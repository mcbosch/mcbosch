## Favorite Project
### [magnetwork](https://github.com/mcbosch/magnetwork)
In the past year, I worked on a project about Graph Neural Networks to classify metabolic networks. To solve this problem, I needed to extend this algorithms for graphs with directed atributes; I've done this working with magnetic graphs. We observed the main problems that these algorithms have on a graph level, the convolution and the optimitzation algorithms among others. Moreover, there are some open questions on the spectra of these types of graphs. 

This project aims to extend the `NetworkX` package, to work easily with these kind of graphs, and be able to study the open questions and new approaches to classify these graphs.
